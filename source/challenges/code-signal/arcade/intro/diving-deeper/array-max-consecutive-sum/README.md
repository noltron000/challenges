# Challenge
Given array of integers, find the maximal possible sum of some *k* consecutive elements.

# Example
Given an array *`[2, 3, 5, 1, 6]`*, the maxmimal rolling sum of *2* consecutive elements should be **8**.
All possible sums of 2 consecutive elements are:
- `2 + 3 = 5`
- `3 + 5 = 8`
- `5 + 1 = 6`
- `1 + 6 = 7`

Thus, the answer is **8**.
