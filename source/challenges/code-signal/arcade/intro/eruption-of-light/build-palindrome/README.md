# Challenge
Given a string, find the shortest possible string;
this can be achieved by adding characters to the end of the initial string to make it a [palindrome].

## Palindrome
A **palindrome** is a string that doesn't change when reversed (it reads the same backward and forward).
- *"eye"* is a palindrome.
- *"noon"* is a palindrome.
- *"decaf faced"* is a palindrome.
- *"taco cat"* is **not** a palindrome (backwards it spells *"tac ocat"*).
- *"racecars"* is **not** a palindrome (backwards it spells *"sracecar"*).

# Example
For a string *"abcdc"*, the output should be *"abcdcba"*.

[palindrome]: #palindrome
