/**
This method takes in a voting pool (an array of numbers),
	and a count of the remaining voters (an integer).
It returns the count of competetive election candidates.
A candidate is competetive if and only if
	they can still win the election with remaining voters.

@param currentVotes
An array of already-cast individual ballots.
Each entry represents a vote for a particular candidate.

@param remainingVotes
An integer counting the  voters who haven't voted yet.
