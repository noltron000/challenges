# Challenge
Given a string, output its longest [prefix] which contains only digits.

## String Prefix
A **prefix** is a non-empty string constructed from the first few characters of the string.

For example, string *"abaca"* has five prefixes:
- *"a"*
- *"ab"*
- *"aba"*
- *"abac"*
- *"abaca"*

# Example
For the string *"123aa1"*, the output should be ***"123"***.

[prefix]: #string-prefix
