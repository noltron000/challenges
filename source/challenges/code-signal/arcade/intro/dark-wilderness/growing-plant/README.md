# Challenge
Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly, you have a plant that grows consistently.
Each day and each night, you record your plant's height.
You have found that it tends to grow by a certain amount each day.
But due to lack of sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night by some amount.

Since you grew your plant from a seed, it started at height *0* initially.
Given its *desired height*, your task is to find how many days in total that it'll take for the plant to reach this height.

# Example
Suppose you want your plant to reach a height of *910*.
With a growth speed of *100* and a decay speed of *10*, it will take **10 days** for the plant to reach this desired height, as shown on the table below.

| #  | Day | Night |
|----|-----|-------|
| 1  | 100 | 90    |
| 2  | 190 | 180   |
| 3  | 280 | 270   |
| 4  | 370 | 360   |
| 5  | 460 | 450   |
| 6  | 550 | 540   |
| 7  | 640 | 630   |
| 8  | 730 | 720   |
| 9  | 820 | 810   |
| 10 | 910 | 900   |

The plant first reaches a height of *910* on **day 10**.
