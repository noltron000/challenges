# Challenge
A **circle of numbers** is a series of integer numbers from *0* to *(n &minus; 1)* written down along a circle, in such a way that the distance between any two neighboring numbers is equal.
(Note that 0 and (n &minus; 1) are neighboring, too.)

Given the value of *n* and some target integer number, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to the target.

# Example
For *n = 10* and a *target of 2*, the output should be **7**.
