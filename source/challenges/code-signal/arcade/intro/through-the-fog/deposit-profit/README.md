# Challenge
You have a specific amount of money into your bank account **deposit**.
Each year your balance increases at the same growth **rate**.
With the assumption that you don't make any additional deposits, find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific **threshold**.

# Example
For a *deposit of 100*, an *interest rate of 20%*, and a *target threshold 170*, the result should be **3 years**.

Each year the amount of money in your account increases by *20%*, compounding annually.
So throughout the years, your balance would be&hellip;.

|        | Total Balance |
|--------|---------------|
| year 0 |          $100 |
| year 1 |          $120 |
| year 2 |          $144 |
| year 3 |        $172.8 |

Thus, it will take **3 years** for your balance to pass the target *threshold*.
