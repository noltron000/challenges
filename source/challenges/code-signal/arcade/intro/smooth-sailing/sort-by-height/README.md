# Challenge
Some people are standing in a row in a park.
There are trees between them which cannot be moved.
Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees.
People can be *very* tall!

# Example
For the array *`[-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180]`*, the sorted output should be **`[-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190]`**.
