# Challenge
Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of different moves the knight can perform.

The knight can move to a square that is two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from it.
The complete move therefore looks like the letter *"L"*.
Check out the image below to see all valid moves for a knight piece that is placed on one of the central squares.

# Example
- Given the cell *"a1"*, the output should be **2**.

- Given the cell *"c2"*, the output should be **6**.

[Knight 3]: ./knight-03.jpg 'Knights have more restricted movement options whilst approaching the edges of the chess board.'
