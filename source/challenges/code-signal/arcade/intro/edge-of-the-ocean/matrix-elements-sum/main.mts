/**
This function serves two main processes:
1. It creates a copy of the given matrix, with some changes.
		If a cell is *0*, the cells below it also become *0*.
2. Next, it returns the sum of all values in the new matrix.

@param rentMatrix
The input matrix contains rent prices of each room in
	an apartment, where array indices represent room numbers.
This should only contain arrays that all have equal lengths.
