/**
This determines whether or not a given sequence
	is already arranged in an increasing order.
It has a tolerance parameter, which allows
	for *1*-off, *2*-off, or *n*-off sequences.

This could also be modified to allow for *decreasing*
	sequences, if the input is reversed.

@param sequence
An array of numbers whose order is important.

@param tolerance
This is positive integer  determines how leniant
	the function is, given an unsorted sequence.
