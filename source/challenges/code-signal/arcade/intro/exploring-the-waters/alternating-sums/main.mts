/**
This uses a round-robin approach to assign two teams.
Each team takes turns getting the next member on the roster.

@param memberWeights
The member array is assumed to be unordered,
	with their weights differing throughout.

@returns
The returned value is the sum of the weights
	for each team, in a simple 2-value array.
