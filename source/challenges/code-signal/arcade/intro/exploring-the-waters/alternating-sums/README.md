# Challenge
Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams.
The first person goes into *team :one:*, the second goes into *team :two:*, the third goes into *team :one:* again, the fourth into *team :two:*, and so on.

You are given an array of positive integers &mdash; the weights of the people.
Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of *team :one:*, and the second element is the total weight of *team :two:* after the division is complete.

# Example
For *`[50, 60, 60, 45, 70]`*, the output should be **`[180, 105]`**.
