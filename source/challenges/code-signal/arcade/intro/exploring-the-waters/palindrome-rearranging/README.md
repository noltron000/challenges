# Challenge
Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a [palindrome].

## Palindrome
A **palindrome** is a string that doesn't change when reversed (it reads the same backward and forward).
- *"eye"* is a palindrome.
- *"noon"* is a palindrome.
- *"decaf faced"* is a palindrome.
- *"taco cat"* is **not** a palindrome (backwards it spells *"tac ocat"*).
- *"racecars"* is **not** a palindrome (backwards it spells *"sracecar"*).

# Example
For the string *"aabb"*, the output should be **`true`**.

We can rearrange *"aabb"* to make *"abba"*, which is a palindrome.

[palindrome]: #palindrome
