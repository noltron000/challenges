# Challenge
Given a divisor and a bound, find the largest integer ***N*** such that:
- ***N*** is divisible by divisor.
- ***N*** is less than or equal to bound.
- ***N*** is greater than 0.

It is guaranteed that such a number exists.

# Example
For a divisor of *3* and a bound of *10*, the output should be **9**.

The largest integer divisible by 3 and not larger than 10 is **9**.
