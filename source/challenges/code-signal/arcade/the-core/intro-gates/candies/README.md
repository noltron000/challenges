# Challenge
A group of children has several pieces of candy.
They want to eat as much candy as they can, but each child must eat exactly the same amount of candy as any other child.
Given the number of children and the number of candies, determine how many pieces of candy will be eaten by all the children together.
Individual pieces of candy cannot be split.

# Example
For *3 candies* and *10 children*, the output should be **9 candies**.

Each child will eat 3 pieces. So the answer is **9**.
