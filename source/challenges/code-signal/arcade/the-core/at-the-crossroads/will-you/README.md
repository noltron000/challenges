# Challenge
Once Mary heard a famous song, and a line from it stuck in her head.
That line was *"Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?"*.
Mary believes that a person is **loved** if and only if he/she is both *young* and *beautiful*, but this is quite a depressing thought, so she wants to put her belief to the test.

Knowing whether a person is *young*, *beautiful* and *loved*, find out if they contradict Mary's belief.

A person contradicts Mary's belief if one of the following statements is true:
- &hellip;they are *young* and *beautiful* but not *loved*.
- &hellip;they are *loved* but not *young* or not *beautiful*.

# Example
- For a person that is *young*, *beautiful*, and *loved*, the output should be **`false`**.

	Young and beautiful people are loved according to Mary's belief, so this case isn't surprising to her.

- For a person that is *young* and *loved*, but not *beautiful*, the output should be **`true`**.

	Mary doesn't believe that people who aren't beautiful can be loved; this contradicts her beliefs.
