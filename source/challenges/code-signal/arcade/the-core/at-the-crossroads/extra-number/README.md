# Challenge
You're given three integers, *a*, *b* and *c*.
It is guaranteed that the first two of these integers are equal to each other.
What is the value of the third integer?

# Example
For *a = 2*, *b = 7*, and *c = 2*, the output should be **7**.

The two equal numbers are *a* and *c*. The third number (*b*) equals **7**, which is the answer.
