# Challenge
You are playing an RPG game.
Currently, the game tracks your *experience points* (XP) total.
To reach the next level, your XP must reach the *XP threshold*.
If you kill the monster in front of you, you will gain an *XP reward*, which is added to your XP total.

Given the values for your XP total, XP threshold, and XP reward, check if you reach the next level after killing the monster.

# Example
- For an experience of *10*, a threshold of *15*, and a reward of *5*, the output should be **`true`**.
- For an experience of *10*, a threshold of *15*, and a reward of *4*, the output should be **`false`**.
